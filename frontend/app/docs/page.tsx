                                    DFIR-AI is designed to support evidence-driven digital
                                    investigations conducted in enterprise, government, and
                                    regulated environments. The platform unifies case management,
                                    evidence handling, timeline reconstruction, and report
                                    generation into a single investigation environment.

                                    Unlike opaque or autonomous security platforms, DFIR-AI
                                    explicitly preserves analyst control. All analytical outputs
                                    are explainable, traceable to source artifacts, and subject to
                                    investigator validation.

                                    DFIR-AI follows a modular architecture consisting of a

                                    services such as databases and object storage.

                                    Capabilities include summarization, correlation support, and
                                    draft report generation.
